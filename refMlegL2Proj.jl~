refMlegL2Proj.jl

ref = reference element
M = Modal
leg = Legendre

a program that returns the coordinates of the L2 projection of a function onto the space spanned by arbitrarly many legendre polynomials on the reference interval [-1, 1].

this amounts too finding uᶜ such that:

               ∑ (ϕᵢ, ϕⱼ) uᶜ = (u , ϕ_i)     ∀i


since these are legendre (aka orthanormal) M = ∑ (ϕᵢ, ϕⱼ) ∀i = I.
