Functions to write:

	  1d advection with global matrices:
	  	  fills u_t and returns
		  
	  1d advection with local matrices:
	          fills u_t and returns

	  advection plotter (better than what I have) (gt?):
	  	    plots u_t as an animation

	  eigenvalue getter of global matrix/plotter for stability

          advection weak form
